# scrollwheel
Bookmarklet that measures how far you've scrolled on a page, silently judging you.

Especially useful for endless-scrolling sites like Facebook, Twitter or 9GAG.

A project by Michele di Modugno and Tobias Bernard.

## Usage

1. Create a new Bookmark in your browser.
2. Use the content of `scrollwheel.js` as the bookmark's URL.
3. Click the bookmark while you're on a website and enjoy being made painfully aware of how much time you're wasting.
